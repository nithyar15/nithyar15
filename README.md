# Hi, I’m Nithya! 👋

I’m a Computer Science graduate student based in Boston, MA with hands-on experience building **production-grade AI systems** at the intersection of **machine learning, generative AI, and large-scale systems**. My work spans research, engineering, and deployment — with a strong focus on turning ambiguous ideas into reliable, real-world solutions.

Currently, I work as an **AI Engineer Intern at Dassault Systèmes (SOLIDWORKS)**, where I build AI-driven design automation systems and contribute to production-facing AI tooling used in CAD workflows. I’ve also worked on distributed ML systems, NLP research, and applied ML projects in healthcare and enterprise environments.

## What I Work On

- **Generative AI & LLM Systems**  
  - RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, hallucination-aware generation  
  - Prompt engineering, evaluation, and grounding models to domain semantics  

- **ML Systems & Infrastructure**  
  - Distributed embedding pipelines (PySpark + PyTorch)  
  - ANN search with FAISS/HNSW  
  - Cloud-based ML workflows (GCP / AWS), performance benchmarking  

- **Vision & Multimodal AI**  
  - Vision-language models for CAD and document understanding  
  - Segmentation, geometric reasoning, and structured output generation  

- **Applied ML Research**  
  - NLP (intent datasets, BiLSTM, embeddings)  
  - Healthcare ML (wearable sensor data, time-series → vision representations)

## What I Care About

I’m especially interested in:
- AI systems that **ship**, not just prototype  
- Robustness, evaluation, and real-world constraints  
- Using AI responsibly in high-impact domains (healthcare, design, infrastructure)  
- Building tools that help *other* engineers and users work better

## Outside of Code

When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me:

- 🏃‍♀️ Running to clear my head  
- ☕ Brewing or hunting for good coffee  
- 🎧 Listening to music pretty much all the time  
- ✈️ Geeking out over airplanes and aviation  
- 🌍 Traveling when I get the chance  
- 🏏 Watching cricket (and getting way too invested)  
- 📚 Reading whenever I can slow down
